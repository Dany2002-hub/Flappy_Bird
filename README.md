# Flappy Bird

The “Flappy Bird” is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the blue
bird, which moves persistently to the right. The game starts once we press the
space button. The players are tasked with navigating the bird through the pipes
that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. The blue bird
automatically descends and only ascends when the player presses space bar.
Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player with one point.
The display also shows the Score and the High scores after each attempt.
